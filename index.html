                <h2>Happy Republic Day</h2>
                <p>Republic Day is a national holiday in India, when the country marks and celebrates 
                    the date on which the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 
                    January 1950, replacing the Government of India Act (1935) as the 
                    governing document of India and thus, turning the nation into a 
                    newly formed republic.[1] The day also marks the transition of India 
                    from an autonomous Commonwealth realm with British Monarch as nominal
                    head of the Indian Dominion, to a fully sovereign republic in the
                    Commonwealth of Nations with the President of India as the nominal 
                    head of the Indian Union.

                    The Constitution was adopted by the Indian Constituent Assembly on 
                    26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950 with a
                    democratic government system, completing the country's transition 
                    towards becoming an independent republic. 26 January was chosen as 
                    the date for Republic day because it was on this day in 1930 when 
                    the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj) was proclaimed
                    by the Indian National Congress in lieu of the Realm status as a 
                    Dominion later instated by the departing British Regime.

                    forces of India and police forces also take part in this parade.</p>
